Hi, I'm Vineet. I am a PhD student in Machine Learning at Purdue ECE. My research broadly focuses on **multimodal learning**, **computer vision**, and **generative models**.

Iâ€™ve worked on contrastive learning for time-series data, adaptive planning with diffusion models, and multimodal learning for cardiac assessment. I'm excited by the transformative potential of AI in healthcare, targeted drug design, scientific discovery and a wide range of other fields.

Feel free to explore this site to learn more about my work, or head to the <a href="/cv/">CV</a> page to view my resume.
